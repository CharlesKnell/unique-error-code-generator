      <h2>The Benefits of using these unique error codes in your software. </h2>
      <div id="benefititems">
        <h3>Uniqueness</h3>
        <p>Exceptionally tiny chance of any of these codes being duplicated in your codebase. 
           The algorithm, codeGenerator.js, can be viewed 
           <a href="https://github.com/CharlesKnell/unique-error-code-generator">here on github</a>. 
           There is no need to store these in a database to avoid reusing an error code.
        </p>
        <h3>Identification of the Point of Origin</h3>
        <p>
           Unique error codes help developers quickly locate a specific issue which occurred in 
           the codebase. </p>
        <h3>Debugging Efficiency</h3>
        <p>By considering the order in which the logged error codes were issued, developers can 
           trace the root cause of problems more efficiently. By looking up each error code, they 
           can find relevant information about the error, helping them understand what went wrong 
           and how to fix it.</p>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>Selected unique error codes are important to include in user documentation. And, all of
          them should be included in developer documentation.
        </p>
        <h3>User Communication</h3>
        <p>When errors occur in a software application, selected unique error codes 
          can be presented to users. This allows users to provide more accurate information when 
          reporting issues, making it easier for support teams to assist them.</p>
        <h3>Versioning and Compatibility</h3>
        <p>As your codebase evolves, these unique error codes remain constant, ensuring 
           consistent error reporting.
        </p>
        <h3>Automated Error Handling</h3>
        <p>Unique error codes facilitate automated error handling. Monitoring tools and scripts 
           can be set up to detect specific error codes and take predefined actions, such as 
           logging the error, sending notifications, or triggering automated recovery processes.
        </p>
        <h3>Third-Party Integration</h3>
        <p>When integrating with third-party services or APIs, unique error codes help in accurately 
           identifying issues and communicating with external systems more effectively.</p>
        <h3>Consistency</h3>
        <p>Using unique error codes promotes consistency in error reporting across the entire 
           software system. This consistency is valuable for both developers and end-users.
        </p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Unique error codes can be used to obfuscate sensitive information about the 
           internal workings of the software. Instead of exposing detailed error messages, 
           which may contain security vulnerabilities, a simple error code can be presented 
           to the user.
        </p>
        <h2>Unique error codes contribute to better software maintainability, debugging 
          efficiency, and user support by providing a standardized and systematic approach 
          to reporting errors.</h2>
